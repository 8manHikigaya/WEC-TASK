# WEC-TASK

(I was trying to implement a discord bot where it answers to users queries and takes information from an online database..
but then I started facing issues with the database registeries and it was too late so I gave up on database)

# Implementation
Discord Bot that uses Supabase database to store information about WEC Club

It reacts to certain keywords

You don't need to use prefixes


# Bugs
Issues connecting with the database


# References Used
Tried to implement this --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Sh19-K7Ko

But starting facing errors with the mysql database so I ended up removing the entire thing
and just made this in the remaining time..
