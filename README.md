# WEC-TASK
I FAILED!
I was trying to implement a discord bot where it answers to users queries and takes information from an online database..
but then I started facing issues with the database registeries and it was too late so I gave up on database

# Implement
It reacts to certain keywords such as "WEC" "convenor" etc etc
You don't need to use prefixes


# Bugs
It can respond to certain queries only since I was only able to only a little data
Very very basic bot

# References Used
Tried to implement this --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Sh19-K7Ko

But starting facing errors with the mysql database so I ended up removing the entire thing
and just made this in the last remaining 30 mins..
